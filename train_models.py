AlphaVox - Nonverbal Cue Model Trainer
-------------------------------------
This script trains models to recognize various nonverbal cues including:
- Body language and gestures
- Vocalizations (grunts, whines)
- Eye movements
- Involuntary movements (ticks)

The trained models are saved to disk for later use in the AlphaVox system.
