To use `replace_derek_with_sonny.py` for renaming "Derek" references in your Python files, here are clear, step-by-step directions:

### How to Use the Replacement Script

#### 1. **Save the Script**
   - Copy the provided code into a file named `replace_derek_with_sonny.py` in your projectâ€™s root directory.

#### 2. **Backup Your Files**
   - Make sure you commit your changes or create a backup, since the script overwrites files in place and changes cannot be undone automatically.

#### 3. **Run the Script**
   - Open a terminal in your project root directory.
   - Execute the script with:
     ```bash
     python replace_derek_with_sonny.py
     ```
   - This will scan all `.py` files in your project and replace every "Derek" / "derek" with "Sonny" / "sonny".

#### 4. **Review Changes**
   - After running, open a few files and verify that all references have been changed appropriately.
   - Test your project to ensure everything still works as expected.

Each step keeps your code safe and ensures the refactoring is completed efficiently [1][2].
