## 🌠 Final Words## 🛠️ Development



We aren't chasing profit. **We're chasing freedom.**### Adding New Modules

1. Create module file in the appropriate directory

We're building AI that doesn't just "work" — it **feels**, it **remembers**, it **cares**.2. Import in the package's `__init__.py`

3. Register in `main.py` if it's a core component

This is AI from the margins, for the world.4. Add tests in `tests/`

5. Update documentation

**This is The Christman AI Project.**

### Code Style

---- Follow PEP 8 standards

- Use type hints

### 💙 Built with Love, Tested with Lived Experience, Engineered with Precision- Document functions with docstrings

- Keep functions focused and modular

*"How can we help you love yourself more?"*- Write tests for new features
